# Self Driving Car AI
This is an attempt to make a simple Self Driving Car AI. The AI uses [Deep Q-Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning), a Reinforcement Learning technique, which tells an agent which action to take under which circumstances. It does not require a model of the environment and can handle problems with stochastic transitions and rewards, without requiring adaptations. AI has been simulated and tested using GUI application created with Kivy.

## Dependencies
1. Pytorch
2. kivy
3. Numpy

## Steps
Run ` python map.py `
